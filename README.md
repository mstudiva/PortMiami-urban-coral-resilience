# PortMiami-urban-coral-resilience

Scripts and data associated with stress testing and coral relocation experiments conducted at UM-CIMAS/NOAA-AOML (https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/experimental-reef-lab/) to determine whether 'urban corals' found on artificial substrates in PortMiami are more resilient to thermal and OA stress compared to their offshore counterparts. This repository is divided up into directories for ex situ stress testing (and associated transcriptomics) and in situ coral relocation experiments.
